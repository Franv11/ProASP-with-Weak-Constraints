# ProASP-with-Weak-Constraints

Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-known problem-solving formal-
ism in computational logic. ASP systems suffer of an intrinsic limitation known
as grounding-bottleneck problem that prevent the evaluation of specific class
of programs. Such limitation as been effectively tackled by compilation-based
method that revealed to be very effective in evaluating problems affected by
grounding issues. However, such kind of systems do not provide an implemen-
tation supporting weak constraints. Weak constraints are a key construct for
modeling optimization problems, where the solution can be defined by optimal
answer sets of an ASP program. In this thesis, we present an extension of the
ProASP system, capable of supporting the usage of weak constraints. Pre-
liminary results demonstrate that the proposed approach introduce significant
performance improvements allowing to solve problem instances that were not
solvable by standard systems.
